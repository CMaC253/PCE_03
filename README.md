# PCE_03 BIT 142 Cascadia College
C# Exercises

## Please consider the following:
 If you clone the project and run it in VS you will notice you can debug different functions because they all will be ran at once.

### The Following topics are displayed here:
  - Simple Loops (While, For, Do..While)
  - Break, Continue
  - Increment/Decrement and Compound Operators
  - Random
  - Nested Loops
  - .NET Built in math functions
  
```
Open at Program.cs in the top folder to analyze the code
```

Not all of the functions will be filled out but at this portion of the class we did not have NUnit tests to consider.
